# 📊 HR Attrition Analysis & Prediction

This project analyzes employee data to identify the key factors contributing to employee attrition and builds machine learning models to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Employee attrition increases hiring costs, reduces productivity, and leads to loss of organizational knowledge.

## 🗂 Dataset
Source: IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset (Kaggle)  
Records: 1,470 employees  
Target Variable: Attrition (Yes / No)

## 🧪 Project Workflow
- Data loading and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering  
- Model building  
- Model evaluation  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
Environment: Google Colab  
Version Control: Git & GitHub

## 📈 Key Insights

Employees with low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance show higher attrition rates

Certain job roles and departments experience higher employee turnover

Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression in predictive accuracy

## 🔮 Future Improvements

Hyperparameter tuning

Feature importance visualization

SHAP / Explainable AI for interpretability

Deployment using Streamlit
